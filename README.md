# Data-Structures
This is one of my first programming courses, where I began to learn how to write code.
I realize much of this code could be written/implemented better and cleaner.

Inside there is an implmentation of:

-An RPG game where I learned how to use classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

-Implementation of a Linked List

-Implementation of a Binary Search Tree

-A Quick Sort Program

-A Red Rover Game

-A 3D maze solver

-And a few other small programs
